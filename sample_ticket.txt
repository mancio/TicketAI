Subject: Cannot access billing page after recent update

Hi support team,

I've been a customer for 2 years and suddenly today I can't access the billing section of my account. 

When I click on "Billing" in the menu, I just get a blank page with an error. I've tried:
- Refreshing the page (multiple times)
- Clearing my browser cache
- Trying a different browser
- Logging out and back in

Nothing works. Can you please fix this urgently? I need to review my recent charges as I think I might have been overcharged. My account number is ACC-123456.

Please let me know what's going on.

Thanks,
John Smith
