# Reflection: AI Limits in This Task

While AI tools excel at generating boilerplate code, config templates, and structured logging patterns, they cannot realistically determine your organization's security posture, compliance requirements, cost thresholds, or team ownership boundaries without human context. AI also cannot predict failure modes unique to your Azure infrastructure, validate that the architecture aligns with your governance policies, or estimate realistic LLM costs for your use case. The skeleton I've built is a **starting point**—it demonstrates production thinking (config separation, structured logs, fail-fast validation)—but production readiness depends on security reviews conducted by your security team, cost modeling with *your actual* LLM pricing and token volumes, and sign-off from leadership on ownership boundaries and risk appetite. Additionally, AI tools cannot make the hard business trade-offs: Is a 5% accuracy loss acceptable to cut costs 50%? Should we auto-action tickets or only recommend to humans? These decisions require domain expertise, stakeholder alignment, and accountability that only humans can provide. The code is a vehicle for *your* decisions, not a substitute for them.
